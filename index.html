        <h2>Nice Guy</h2>
        <p>He started off normal — too normal. We matched on a dating app. Chatted a few times. I wasn’t interested, so I unmatched.
            That’s when it began.
            First, he messaged me on Instagram. Then TikTok. He commented on my YouTube videos. He made new accounts every time I blocked him.
            He sent emails. Then letters. Actual handwritten letters to my workplace. I never gave him that address.
            I started to feel insane. No one took it seriously. People said, “It’s just online. Just ignore him.”
            But he started tagging me in places I’d just been — a coffee shop, a park, even my gym. Like he was always ten steps behind.
            I moved. I changed my number. I scrubbed my digital presence.
            But even now, when I hear a random ping from my phone, I freeze.
            What if it’s him again?</p>

        <h2>The Garden</h2>
        <p>I just wanted some fresh air. There’s a public garden near my flat — quiet, peaceful, full of overgrown hedges and winding stone paths. I go there when my head’s too loud.
            That evening, it was golden outside. I had music in one ear and birdsong in the other. Then I noticed him. A man. Sitting on a bench. Nothing strange. But when I turned down a path, he stood up.
            I took another turn. He followed.
            I slowed. He slowed.
            I stopped. So did he. Just stood there. Watching. Silent.
            There was nowhere to go — just trees and hedges. I picked up a broken stick from the ground, holding it like a weapon.
            Finally, I ran. Full sprint. Didn’t care if I looked insane.
            When I reached the road, he wasn’t behind me anymore.
            I still go on walks, but not alone. Not there. Not ever again.</p>

          <h2>Workplace</h2>
          <p>It started with shoulder squeezes.
            Then handshakes that lasted too long.
            One day, he stood behind me while I worked and ran his fingers down my arm — slow, casual, like it meant nothing.
            I asked him not to touch me. He smiled and said, “You’ll miss it when I stop.”
            I reported it to HR. They said they’d look into it.
             Nothing changed.
            He just started calling me “difficult” in meetings.
            Eventually, I quit.
            And the worst part? He’s still there.</p>

          <h2>The Bridge</h2>
          <p>I was walking home late, headphones on. There weren’t many people around, just the sound of my shoes on pavement. That’s when I heard another pair.
            Behind me. Steady. Getting closer.
            I crossed the street. So did he.
            I ducked into a shortcut near a construction site. He followed.
            I sped up. He sped up.
            I ran.
            There’s a bridge near my building. I reached it, breathless, heart screaming in my chest. And this thought — this awful thought — crept into my head:
            What if I just jumped?
            Not because I wanted to die. But because it felt safer than what was coming up behind me.
            I didn’t. I screamed instead. Loud. Wild. He turned and vanished.
            I didn’t sleep that night. Not really since</p>

          <h2>Outside</h2>
          <p>I don’t go out much anymore.
            Not because I don’t want to — but because since it happened, everything feels unsafe.
            He touched me. Followed me. Cornered me.
             Whatever you want to call it,
             it changed me.
            Now my brain won’t shut up.
            It replays the moment on loop — what I should’ve done, how it felt, how no one helped. Even when I’m sitting on the couch or brushing my teeth, it’s there.
            Loud.
            People say it’ll pass. That time heals. But all time’s done is make the silence heavier. And when it’s quiet, it’s the only thing I hear.</p>

          <h2>Always there</h2>
          <p>It doesn’t matter how I dress, where I go, or what I say.</p>
          <p>
            They always find me.</p>
            <p>
            In school, it was the teacher who stared too long. On the bus, the man who whispered filth into my hair. At work, it was my boss. At a funeral, it was a relative’s friend.
            I tried changing routes. Covering up. Smiling less. Smiling more. Holding keys between my fingers.
             Pretending to talk on the phone. Pretending I wasn’t scared.
            And still, they come.</p>

           <p>

            The trauma isn’t something I carry — it’s in me now. Like a second skin. A permanent shadow.
            I hate that when I walk alone, I’m never truly alone. </p>
            Even when I’m safe, I don’t feel safe.
            Even when I’m home, I check the locks three times
            It’s like they rewired something in me — and I can’t remember what it felt like before.</p>

          <h2>Haunted</h2>
          <p>I don’t even remember his name anymore. But his shadow still knows mine.
            I see him in strangers. In the man brushing too close on the train.
            In the guy who stares too long when I’m tying my shoe. In the footsteps behind me that don’t even match his pace — but my heart doesn’t care. It races anyway.
            I’ve switched my routes. Changed my clothes. Deleted my photos. And still, I carry him.
            He ruined more than a moment. He ruined silence. He ruined trust. He ruined being alone without feeling alone.
            Some days, I forget it happened. And then I’ll smell his cologne on someone else, or someone’s hand will brush mine by accident — and I’m there again. Paralyzed. Angry. Exhausted. Stuck in that loop of “Why me?” and “Why didn’t I fight harder?”
            He’s not here anymore, but he is. Every time I cross a street at night, check my backseat, or apologize for taking up space
            he is.
            This isn’t about one man. It’s about how the world teaches them they can leave, and how we’re the ones who stay haunted.</p>
